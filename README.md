## Code review by [Jon McGarvie](https://github.com/trilisen) and [Victor Stranne](https://github.com/Vstranne)

- The first call to action button is slightly covered by the div-element surrounding the dog picture below. Making parts of the button not clickable in desktop view.
- Clean code, well structured and easy to follow.
- 71% performance on web.dev, complaining about unused javascript.
- The first and the last CTA-buttons look alot alike but one has a hover animation and the other not, a bit inconsistent.
- When focusing the input fields, the border of the focus is not the same as the initial.
